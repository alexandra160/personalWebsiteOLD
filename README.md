This is part of an assignment from semester 3, that I had to develop. I recreated this website in a responisve and more efficient manner and can be accesed through the following link: 

The project was created with HTML&CSS, Javascript, NodeJS and MongoDB. I also tried incorporating some React elements, but I am fairly new to it so the code is not so complex. I am eager to learn more React and implement it in future projects.

Unfortunately, the free MongoDB Cloud DataBase expired, so the links from projects are not accesible anymore - however, all the projects mentioned there + more are available in this GitHub repository.
